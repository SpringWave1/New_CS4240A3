Our Game: The Running Dead
Inspired by the popular L4D zombie apocalypse survival FPS series,
our group decided that it would be thrilling and exciting to have 
a VR game where players get to experience fighting zombies who have invaded
a safe house during a zombie apocalypse. Pick up your weapons and defeat 
muscular and fast zombies!

How to play:

The main objective of the game is simple. Shoot zombies with weapons scattered 
all over the safe house and earn as many points as possible. 

Controls:
1. Moving
    - x, y axis/4th, 5th axis on the controllers
    - Up, down, left and right on the controllers correspond to
      moving forward, backwards, left and right
    - Turn your body to change the direction that you are facing accordingly

2. Teleporting
    - Press and hold the 9th axis to show the teleportation indicator
    - If the indicator is blue, the location that the indicator lands on
      can be teleported to. Otherwise if it is red, re-adjust your aim and find
      a teleportable location
    - Release the 9th axis to teleport to the location that the indicator points to 

3. Picking up/Dropping weapons
    - Move towards the weapon that you want to pick up (make sure you are close enough)
    - Reach your right hand (holding the controller) towards the weapon 
    - Press and hold the 12th axis to grab the weapon
    - Release your hold on the 12th axis while a weapon is in your (right) hand to drop it

4. Shooting    
    - With a weapon in your (right) hand, point it towards your target and press
      the 10th axis to fire your weapon
